# uiSNR Maps in the torso of realistic body models

This repository contains uploaded **ultimate intrinsic SNR (uiSNR)** maps generated from electromagnetic simulations using:

- The **truncated Duke model**: a modified version of the original Duke model (Virtual Family) from the neck to the thighs. 
- The **Ella model**

## Notes

- EM bases simulations were conducted according to Guerin B, Villena JF, Polimeridis AG, et al. The ultimate signal-to-noise ratio in realistic body models. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine. Nov 2017;78(5):1969-1980. doi:10.1002/mrm.26564
- uiSNR maps were calculated as: $B_0^2 \sqrt{B_1^{-H} (\mathbf{r}) \Psi^{-1} B_1^- (\mathbf{r})}$
